// 7.13(Duplicate Elimination with array) Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem. Read in 20
// numbers, each of which is between 10 and 100, inclusive. As each number is read, validate it and store it in the
// array only if it isn’t a duplicate of a number already read. After reading all the values, display only the unique
// values that the user entered. Provide for the “worst case” in which all 20 numbers are different. Use the smallest
// possible array to solve this problem.
